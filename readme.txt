Do you want to control how many time have you spent working behind your vb projects?

SpyIDE runs on the try icon and detects any VB project that you are working on. When the project closes, SpyIDE will ask you a summary description about all changes made to the project and log the elapsed time and description. therefore, you will be able to check, at the end, the elapsed time to code a given project



Note: If you will find bugs or will you modify something please let me know all changes you think to do.

Thank you
